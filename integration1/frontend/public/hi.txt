Problem Statement: Iris Tracking, Blink Counting, and Face Emotion Detection using MediaPipe

Introduction:
The field of computer vision offers diverse applications in understanding human behavior and emotions. This project aims to develop a comprehensive system that utilizes the capabilities of the MediaPipe library in Python to address three distinct challenges: accurate iris tracking and blink counting, and real-time face emotion detection.

Problem Statement:
The main challenge of this project is to design and implement a system that can accurately track irises, count blinks, and detect facial emotions in real-time using the MediaPipe FaceMesh library. The following specific problems need to be addressed:
